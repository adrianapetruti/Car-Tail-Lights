# Car-Tail-Lights
This was a team project that I've created with one of my colleagues. 
It was about designing a controller for tail lights. The car left and right tail lights which flash in unique patterns to indicate left and right turns. We've created 
this project in Vivado, using VHDL. It was a great opportunity for us to put in practice the knowledge we have assimilated in college classes and to come up with 
innovative ideas from which to achieve the project's goal. We've learned how to search for information, how to link the information, how to solve potential errors that 
could have appeared and most importantly, to work as a team and to understand each other's point of view.
